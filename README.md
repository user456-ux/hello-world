## Considerations üõ†Ô∏è
- What is your purpose for a Static Site e.g. no database or dynamic content aside from a consuming an API in your index.htm
- Static sites are great for blogs, resumes, learning Git, source code sharing etc
- GitHub follows the public repo / public page/site model
  -  You can publish a private a repo package to a public page
  -  You can publish your page and then mark your repo private </br>
     this will reset your and repo and require you to re0enable your public/publish settings for future updates
- Consider a private repo / private site model like below alterantives if you would like youe source code private </br>
     bear in mind this **defeats the purpose** of a collabortive repo but will protect yor intellual rights.
     
- Alterantives that support a true private repo / private page model
  - [Bitbucket (Atlassian/Jira)][l1]
  - [Firebase (google supports .Net)][l2]
  - [Gitlab][l3]
  - [Neocities][l4]
  - [Netlify][l5]
  - [Vercel][l6]
  - [SmarterASP.NET][l7]
